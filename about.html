        <p>Hi there! My name is Rishav Raj and I am a BCA student who is passionate about programming. <br>
            With a decent amount of programming knowledge and ongoing learning, I am constantly striving <br>
             to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            From an early age, I was fascinated by the world of computers and technology. As I started my <br>
            studies in BCA, I discovered my passion for programming and have been actively learning and <br> 
            exploring various programming languages and frameworks.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Through my academic studies and personal projects, I have gained experience in programming<br>
            languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I also have experience in web development<br> technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            As I continue to learn and explore new technologies, I am excited about the opportunities that lie<br>
             ahead. I am eager to apply my programming knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and<br>
              contribute to the advancement of technology.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am always open to connecting with<br>
             others who share similar interests and am excited about what the future holds.
        </p>
